# okay, so as i'm brushing up on my math skills as i haven't taken a math class in close to 10 years,
# i come across a khan academy practice session that, like, i understand the math, i just don't wanna do it!
# so i thought to myself, "why not automate this shit?!"
# this is my FIRST TIME automating, and it feeels so good!

# so this function will calculate the exponential growth as a function of the exponent (usually time)
def calculate_exponential_growth(base, growth, exponent):
    product = 0
    product = base * growth ** exponent
    return product

# this function will calculate the linear growth as a function of time
def calculate_linear_growth(base, growth, time):
    product = 0
    product = base + growth * time
    return product

#^^ the above functions are calculated in explicit form, but i think i will play with
# writing them in recursive form so i can practice programming with recursion.

# the khan academy questions wanted to know when the exponential growth would exceed
# the linear growth. how annoying lol. 

# this function will call the two functions above and compare the values in a while loop
# once the value for the exponential function exceeds that of the linear,
# the loop ends and the function returns the year where the exp exceeds the linear

def determine_bigger_growth():
    year = 0
    exp_growth = 0.0
    lin_growth = 1

    while lin_growth > exp_growth:
        exp_growth = calculate_exponential_growth(20000, 1.05, year)
        lin_growth = calculate_linear_growth(25000, 500, year)
        year += 1

    return year

practice = determine_bigger_growth()
print(practice)
